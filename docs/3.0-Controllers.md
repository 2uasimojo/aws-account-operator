# Controllers

## 3.1. AccountPool Controller

The accountpool-controller is triggered by a create or change to an accountpool CR or an account CR. It is responsible for filling the Acccount Pool by generating new account CRs.

It looks at the accountpool CR *spec.poolSize* and it ensures that the number of unclaimed accounts matches the number of the poolsize. If the number of unclaimed accounts is less then the poolsize it creates a new account CR for the account-controller to process.

### 3.1.1. Constants and Globals

```go
emailID = "osd-creds-mgmt"
```

### 3.1.2. Status

Updates accountPool CR

```yaml
  claimedAccounts: 4
  poolSize: 3
  unclaimedAccounts: 3
```

*claimedAccounts* are any accounts with the `status.Claimed=true`

*unclaimedAccounts* are any accounts with `status.Claimed=false` and `status.State!="Failed"`.

*poolSize* is the poolsize from the accountPool spec

### 3.1.3. Metrics

Updated in the accountPool-controller

```txt
MetricTotalAccountCRs
MetricTotalAccountCRsUnclaimed
MetricTotalAccountCRsClaimed
MetricTotalAccountPendingVerification
MetricTotalAccountCRsFailed
MetricTotalAccountCRsReady
MetricTotalAccountClaimCRs
```

## 3.2. Account Controller

The account-controller is triggered by creating or changing an account CR. It is responsible for following behaviors:

If the *awsLimit* set in the constants is not exceeded:

1. Creates a new account in the organization belonging to credentials in secret `aws-account-operator-credentials`
2. Configures two AWS IAM users from *iamUserNameUHC* and *iamUserNameSRE* as their respective usernames
    - Creates IAM user in new account
    - Attaches Admin policy
    - Generates a secret access key for the user
    - Stores user secret in a AWS secret
3. Creates STS CLI tokens
    - Creates Federated webconsole URL using the *iamUserNameSRE* user
4. Creates and Destroys EC2 instances
5. Creates aws support case to increase account limits

**Note:**
*iamUserNameUHC* is used by Hive to provision clusters
*iamUserNameSRE* is used to generate Federated console URL

### 3.2.1. Additional Functionality

- If `status.RotateCredentials == true` the account-controller will refresh the STS Cli Credentials
- If the account's `status.State == "Creating"` and the account is older then the *createPendTime* constant the account will be put into a `failed` state
- If the account's `status.State == AccountReady && spec.ClaimLink != ""` it sets `status.Claimed = true`

### 3.2.2. Constants and Globals

```go
iamUserNameUHC          = "osdManagedAdmin"

caseSeverity                  = "high"
caseDesiredInstanceLimit      = 25
caseStatusResolved            = "resolved"
intervalAfterCaseCreationSecs = 30
intervalBetweenChecksSecs     = 30

// AccountPending indicates an account is pending
AccountPending = "Pending"
// AccountCreating indicates an account is being created
AccountCreating = "Creating"
// AccountFailed indicates account creation has failed
AccountFailed = "Failed"
// AccountReady indicates account creation is ready
AccountReady = "Ready"
// AccountPendingVerification indicates verification (of AWS limits and Enterprise Support) is pending
AccountPendingVerification = "PendingVerification"
// IAM Role name for IAM user creating resources in account
accountOperatorIAMRole = "OrganizationAccountAccessRole"

*awsAccountID* is updated with the account ID of the aws account that is created by the account controller

*claimLink* holds the name of the accountClaim that has claimed this account CR

*iamUserSecret* holds the name of the secret containing IAM user credentials for the AWS account

### 3.2.4. Status

Updates the Account CR

  supportCaseID: "00000000"
```

*state* can be any f the account states defined in the constants below:

- AccountPending indicates an account is pending
- AccountCreating indicates an account is being created
- AccountFailed indicates account creation has failed
- AccountReady indicates account creation is ready
- AccountPendingVerification indicates verification (of AWS limits and Enterprise Support) is pending

*claimed* is true if `currentAcctInstance.Status.State == AccountReady && currentAcctInstance.Spec.ClaimLink != "`
*rotateCredentials* updated by the secretwatcher pkg which will set the bool to true triggering an reconcile of this controller to rotate the STS credentials
*supportCaseID* is the ID of the aws support case to increase limits
*conditions* indicates the last state the account had and supporting details

### 3.2.5. Metrics

## 3.3. AccountClaim Controller

The accountClaim-controller is triggered when an accountClaim is created in any namespace. It is responsible for following behaviours:

1. Sets account `spec.ClaimLink` to the name of the accountClaim
2. Sets accountClaim `spec.AccountLink` to the name of an unclaimed Account
3. Creates a secret in the accountClaim namespace that contains the credentials tied to the aws account in the accountCR
4. Sets accountClaim `status.State = "Ready"`

### 3.3.1. Constants and Globals

## 3.4 AWSFederatedRole Controller

The AWSFederatedRole-controller is triggered when an AWSFederatedRoke is created in any namespace. It is responsible for following behaviours:

1. Building AWS Policy Doc from Role definition in the spec
2. Attempting to validate the Role in AWS by creating the Role, and deleting it if successful
3. Setting the status to Valid or Failed
4. If the status is Valid or Failed, stop all reconciling
5. If an AWSFederatedRole is deleted, cleaning up any instance of the Role in AWS by cleaning up any AWSFederatedAccountAccesses using the AWSFederatedRole 

### 3.4.1. Constants and Globals

None

### 3.4.2. Spec

```yaml
spec:
  roleDisplayName: Example Role
  roleDescription: This is an example Role

    description: Description of Example Custom Policy
    # list of statements for the policy
    awsStatements:
      - effect: Allow
        action:
        - "aws-portal:ViewAccount"
        - "aws-portal:ViewBilling"
        resource: 
        - "*"
  # list of  AWS managed

   - "AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess"
   - "IAMReadOnlyAccess"
```
*roleDisplayName* is a human-readable name for the Role
*roleDescription* is a human-readable description for what the Role does
*awsCustomPolicy* is a representation of an AWS Policy to be created as part of the Role. It contains a Policy name a description,

## 3.5 AWSFederatedAccountAccess Controller

The AWSFederatedAccountAccess-controller is triggered when an accountClaim is created in any namespace. It is responsible for following behaviours:

1. Ensures the requested AWSFederatedRole exists
2. Converts the AWSFederatedRole spec into an AWS Policy Doc
3. Creates a unique AWS Role in the AWS containing the OSD cluster using the AWSFederatedRole definition
